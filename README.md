# Tamagotchi
Well, this a project that I do for fun. I doing it in Angular to grow my protafolio, and with Babylon for the 3D models.

## What is it? 
Is a game, that we got a pet that we should fead, and mantain happy, and be constantly watching for it.

## Tech

* [Babylon.js](https://doc.babylonjs.com/)
* [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax/)
* Angular 19.0.2

## Rules

## Features

* Hunger meter, Happy meter and a Training meter to determine how healthy and well-behaved the pet is
 	* Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of bread or hamburger) or a snack (usually a piece of candy or cake). 
	* Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini-games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini-games usually vary between versions. 
	* The Training meter (formerly called Discipline in earlier releases) can be filled by pressing the "scold" option when a pet calls for attention despite neither its hunger or happy meter being full, calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal and in later models, sending a prank gift to a friend.
* Age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet
